Here are the explanations of the tests written to analyse what does the preprocessor do and how does it do it

----------- test1.h and test1.c -----------
test1.h and test1.c are used to see how the preprocessor includes one file into another, also we can
see that even though test1.c itself does not include stdio.h we can still use its fucntions, that is
because we are including test.h in which we have included stdio.h 

----------- test2.h, test22.h and test2.c -----------
test2.h is included in test22.h and both of them are included in test2.c which means that test2.h will be
included twice in test2.c, this can cause errors and if it doesnt then it will needlesly cost time 
adding #ifndef prevents this
-> when including test22.h in test2.c, test22.h will first include test2.h into test22.h and then it will include
   that into test2.c
   because test2.h was already included in test22.h the #ifndef statement will be false when test2.c tries to 
   include it again, that means the preprocessor will skip the code wrapped in #ifndef #endif

-> when including test2.h in test2.c first test2.h will be included right away but when test2.c tries to then include
   test22.h, test22.h will not include test2.h into itself because the #ifndef statement will be false and instead just
   the code in test22.h will be included into test2.c
--> this means that in the test2.c file the order of code will be the same no mather which header we include first


----------- test3.h, test33.h dir/test33.h test3.c -----------
- -Idir flag adds dir only to the < > search path, but " " will still find it by calling < > 
- -iquotedir flag adds dir to the " " path so " " wont need to call < > because it will find it on its own
- "" will first look in th current directory and then in the dir specified by -iquote, because in after running
  cpp -iquotedir test3.c a = 1, which means that it found test33.h before dir/test33.h and then stopped looking
  
----------- test4.c -----------  
- -D is a compile time flag for gcc
- gcc -DTEST input -o output defines TEST which means that the #ifdef TEST block will be processed and #ifndef TEST would be skipped

----------- test5.c -----------  
- testing compile time optimization flags
