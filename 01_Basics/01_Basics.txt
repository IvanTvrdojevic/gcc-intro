- Only source files are passed to the compiler (header files arent)
- Source files are opened only once, header fies can be oppened multiple times

Preprocessor
- expands macros and include files in source code (#include #define)
- cpp source.c source.i

Compiler 
- expanded source code is compiled into assembly language
- gcc -S source.i

Assembly 
- assembly code is compiled into an object file with machine code that os readable 
  by a specific processor architecture
- as source.s -o source.o

Linker
- links object files together into a single object file 
- links symbols from other objects and external liraries together
  to create a single object file
-> symbol: a reference to a component (function/global var) in an object
- ld
